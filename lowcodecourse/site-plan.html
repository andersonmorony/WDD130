    <p>
      The major ideal to my website is promote my services as a low code developer, what is low code development and how
      could it be implement in you company and in our clients.
      So, I’ll writing some paragraph about ‘what is low code’ and ‘what are the benefit’ with some imagens, also I will
      be writing about a specific platform and writing about each product and tools that could be it build.
    </p>
    <p>
      Will have some imagen about each tool and options to build and apply the automations with low code, when the
      buttons will be clicked, the user will be redirect to contract page, for to fill the fields with owner information
      to contact, each button in this second session will have the same action.
      In the third session, will have just one background image, there will have a graphic image about all power
      platform products and a litter text, in this text will have a strong phrase to read.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the last one will have one title and one text talk about the low code benefit and how the visitor can user it.
      And a litter about my experience and information about my oldest client and services.
      I want create a page about us, when I will talk more about my experience with some projects and how the power
      platform helps me to got delivered all project in a short time and with excellence.

    </p>
    <p>
      What is need to user low code in my projects?<br />
      Low code is the new bet of Microsoft and others big companies, is 80% percent faster than others projects and the
      understanding about the project is easily to understand and to building. Is easier to learn and build new
      solutions, because have a pattern to follow and is friendly to understand.
      Have a lot connection allow to you integrate with various data sources and databases, APIs and external services
      and all with the enough security enabled by Microsoft and Azure AD.
      You will get build faster automation without need have a big knowledge about the connector integration, with some
      click.
      The tests is already integrated and auto, doesn’t need big knowledge to see the logs and errors, and is so
      friendly to see all.
